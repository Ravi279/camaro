# Camaro

A sample inheritance example using Ruby.

In this example we will create an instance of Camaro and tell it to drive, we will assume itâ€™s moving in a straight line and there are no other driving factors.  The car will accelerate until it hits its max speed.  It is required that drive will call accelerate. It is required accelerate will increment the current speed by 1.  Once the Camaro reaches max speed it should stop accelerating and print that it hit the cars max speed.  The execution of drive should then also stop.

## Usage

Run the script using the ruby console.
